	abstract = {A study has been made on the parametric excitation of a nonlinear system with hardening springs. In the parametric excitation of linear systems, the only subharmonic predicted is a subharmonic of order 1/2. However, in the parametric excitation of non-linear systems, it is shown that higher order subharmonics can exist, depending both on the amplitude and frequency of the parametric excitation.},

	abstract = {Dynamic behavior of a weightless rod with a point mass sliding along the rod axis according to periodic law is studied. This is the pendulum with periodically varying length which is also treated as a simple model of child's swing. Asymptotic expressions for boundaries of instability domains near resonance frequencies are derived. Domains for oscillation, rotation, and oscillation-rotation motions in parameter space are found analytically and compared with numerical study. Two types of transitions to chaos of the pendulum depending on problem parameters are investigated numerically.},
